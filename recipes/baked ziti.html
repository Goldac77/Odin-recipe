        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Baked ziti is a popular casserole with ziti 
            pasta and a Neapolitan-style tomato-based 
            sauce characteristic of Italian-American 
            cuisine. It is a form of pasta al forno. 
            Typically, the pasta is first boiled separately 
            until it is nearly, but not completely, done. It takes
        about 2 hours and 20 mins to prepare</p>

        <h3>Making the magic happen</h3>
        <div class="prep">
          <ul>
            <li>Cut down the length of each sausage with a sharp knife. Remove and discard casings.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large saucepan set over high heat. Add sausages and onion. Cook, 
                stirring occasionally and breaking up with a spatula, until the sausage begins to 
                brown, and the onion turns translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add oregano, thyme, 
                and rosemary and cook for 1 minute more. Pour in marinara sauce. Pour 1 cup water 
                into each jar to rinse out remaining sauce; add to the saucepan. Stir together and 
                bring sauce to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low, and let simmer, stirring occasionally, 
                for 1 hour. Taste for seasoning and adjust if needed. Turn off heat and 
                reserve until needed. Before using, skim any excess fat that rises to the surface.</li>
            <li>While sauce simmers, bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. 
                Add ziti and cook, stirring occasionally, for 1 or 2 minutes less than the directions 
                on the package call for, about 8 minutes. Drain well and transfer into a large mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Carefully add the meat sauce and stir until thoroughly combined. Let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a large 9x15-inch or 
                9x13-inch casserole dish with a drizzle of olive oil.</li>
            <li>Use a slotted spoon to transfer half of the pasta and sauce mixture to the prepared dish, 
                then use a spatula to even out into a uniform layer. Top with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese, 
                1/2 of the mozzarella cheese, and then 1/2 of the grated Pecorino Romano cheese, 
                being sure to distribute evenly. Top with the rest of the pasta and sauce mixture and 
                give the pan a little shake to settle the sauce. Repeat the cheese application.</li>
            <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until the cheese is melted and the casserole is 
                piping hot, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool 10 to 15 minutes before serving. Top with parsley.</li>
